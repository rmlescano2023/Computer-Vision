The goal of this laboratory exercise is to estimate the amount of liquid contained in a bottle.

The accompanying directories (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rLQPUpJejYdw77dnDq5RdISKF-ndL0lY?usp=sharing)
contain the images of the bottle with a specified amount of contained liquid.

Thus, the directory 50mL contains pictures of the bottle with 50 mL liquid in it. And so on...
The directory 'guess' contains images of the bottle with unknown amounts of liquid. You are to guess these amounts.

OpenCV image filtering, thresholding, or morphology operations are allowed.

Hints:
Count the number of pixels corresponding to the liquid and have it mapped to the labelled amount.
OR
Compute the area (or some other measure) of the region occupied by the liquid in the image and have it mapped to the labelled amount.


Use interpolation or regression to guess the unknown amounts.
